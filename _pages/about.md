I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Public Health Sciences at the Penn State College of Medicine. Before joining Penn State, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the CAUSALab at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. I received an MD from the National Taiwan University and a Sc.D. from the Departments of Nutrition and Epidemiology at Harvard. 

My research focuses on developing and applying novel causal inference methods to inform decisions, with a substantive focus on pregnancy and cardiovascular health. Our work addresses the limited transportability of inference in randomized trials as well as the complexities arising from compound treatment, time-varying confounding, competing events, missing data, and model misspecification when using observational data to draw causal inferences. These challenges motivate my methodological research in the following areas: (1) The target trial framework to study the health effects of dietary strategies (using large longitudinal cohorts) and treatment safety in pregnancy (using real-world data); (2) Methods for synthesizing evidence from multiple data sources (trials or observational studies) and extending inference to a new target population of interest.
