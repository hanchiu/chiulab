I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Public Health Sciences at the Penn State College of Medicine. In July 2025, I will join the Department of Epidemiology at the Brown University School of Public Health as a tenure-track Assistant Professor. I hold an MD from National Taiwan University and an ScD in Nutrition and Epidemiology from Harvard, followed by a postdoctoral fellowship at the CAUSALab at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

My research focuses on developing and applying novel causal inference methods to inform decisions, with a substantive focus on pregnancy and cardiovascular health. Our work addresses the limited transportability of inference in randomized trials as well as the complexities arising from compound treatment, time-varying confounding, competing events, missing data, and model misspecification when using observational data to draw causal inferences. These challenges motivate my methodological research in the following areas: (1) The target trial framework to study the health effects of dietary strategies (using large longitudinal cohorts) and treatment safety in pregnancy (using real-world data); (2) Methods for synthesizing evidence from multiple data sources (trials or observational studies) and extending inference to a new target population of interest.
